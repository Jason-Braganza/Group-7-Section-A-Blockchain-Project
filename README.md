# Group-7-Section-A-Blockchain-Project
Blockchain Project created by Group 7 from Section A

Supply chain applications operate in a multi-stakeholder environment, and they demand trust, provenance, and transparency. Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralised infrastructure with different stakeholders enabling these functionalities. Blockchain technology is suited for multi-stakeholder supply chain applications because of these mechanisms. This project describes one of the supply chain network's pain points and how Blockchain can help solve it. In particular, this /projectr discusses how an asset can be tracked from its origin to its final delivery point thereby establishing data and trust management using blockchain technology. The design details of the decentralized asset tracking system are explained along with the tools used to build it. The chapter concludes by underscoring the design challenges and open opportunities in the blockchain-based asset tracking system build for the supply chain domain.
